# Court Vision Predict

This project is currently being developed for the Spring 2024, CSC330: Software Design and Developement, class at Southern Connecticut State University.

Background and Project Conception:

Users of this platform can stay updated on their favorite teams and players,
receiving real-time updates. They have access to comprehensive statistics,
allowing them to gauge performance trends and stay informed about popular
events. Moreover, they can anticipate upcoming matchups through current
predictions and even cast their own predictions, potentially challenging or
supporting those provided by CVP's Predictions. Users have the freedom to
personalize their profiles with their preferred teams and players.

CVP users will be able to perform the following functions:
- View statistics of teams, players and view events that are trending.
- View the current predictions of upcoming match ups
- Cast predictions for or against CVPâ€™s Predictions.
- Style their own profile with their favorite teams and players.

For testing the Court Vision Predict Web Application, the following user account has been created:
- username: user618
- email: myemail@gmail.com
- password: 123

How To Run The Application:

This application was built using Flask, a lightweight web framework written in Python. To properly execute the application,
the instillation of Flask is required, as well as any of its additional dependencies used libraries within this app
(Flask Works, Flask-SQLAlchamey). Further, Scikit-Learn, a vast Python-based machine learn library, was used
to develop the AI model which allowd for the prediciton of upcoming games (using a Decision Tree classifier model).
