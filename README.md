# Court Vision Predict

This project is currently being developed for the Spring 2024, CSC330: Software Design and Developement, class at Southern Connecticut State University.

Background and Project Conception:

Users of this platform can stay updated on their favorite teams and players,
receiving real-time updates. They have access to comprehensive statistics,
allowing them to gauge performance trends and stay informed about popular
events. Moreover, they can anticipate upcoming matchups through current
predictions and even cast their own predictions, potentially challenging or
supporting those provided by CVP's Predictions. Users have the freedom to
personalize their profiles with their preferred teams and players. Additionally, they
can engage with the community by creating, viewing, and participating in discussion
boards, fostering interaction and discourse within the platform.

CVP users will be able to perform the following functions:
- Follow teams/players and receive updates about them.
- View statistics of teams, players and view events that are trending.
- View the current predictions of upcoming match ups
- Cast predictions for or against CVPâ€™s Predictions.
- Style their own profile with their favorite teams and players.
- Create, view and post on discussion boards.
